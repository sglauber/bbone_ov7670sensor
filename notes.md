The BBB has an on-board I2S interface, which makes interfacing an external DAC easy.
The I2S interface is connected from the AM3359 processor to the HDMI chip (TDA19988) but it is not required for HDMI to be used in order to make use of the I2S interface. 
The I2S interface is brought out to some pins on port P9 (see here for details).
It was encouraging that Technoshaman and Donald Miller had some success with the interface, so I wanted to try it out and I got some time today.
